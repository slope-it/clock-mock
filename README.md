ClockMock provides a way for mocking the current timestamp used by PHP for \DateTime(Immutable) objects and date/time
related functions. It requires the [uopz extension](https://github.com/krakjoe/uopz) (version >= 6.1.1).

**This library is meant for development and testing only. It does not aim to propose a clock service to be used in
production code, as we believe that you shouldn't need to do that when your only purpose is to mock the current time in
testing code.**

## Why we built it

- We were looking for a way to mock the native php date and time functions and classes without having to change our
  production code for it, and without having ot use any 3rd party library for handling dates/clocks.
- For this purpose, we were previously using the `php-timecop` extension. The problem is that said extension never
  implemented support for PHP 7.4 onward. That extension currently does not even build for PHP 8.0.

## Installation

You can install the library using Composer. Run the following command to install the latest version from Packagist:

``` bash
composer require --dev slope-it/clock-mock
```

Note that, as this is not a tool intended for production, it should be required only for development (`--dev` flag).

## Mocked functions/methods

- date()
- date_create()
- date_create_immutable()
- getdate()
- gettimeofday()  
- gmdate()
- gmmktime()
- gmstrftime()
- idate()
- localtime()
- microtime()
- mktime()
- strftime()  
- strtotime()
- time()
- unixtojd()
- DateTime::__construct
- DateTimeImmutable::__construct

## Functions/methods with missing mocks (HELP NEEDED!)

- date_create_from_format()
- date_create_immutable_from_format()
- DateTime::createFromFormat
- DateTimeImmutable::createFromFormat
- $_SERVER['REQUEST_TIME']

## Usage

### 1. Stateful API

You can call `ClockMock::freeze` with a \DateTime or \DateTimeImmutable. Any code executed after it will use that
specific date and time as the current timestamp.
Call `ClockMock::reset` when done to restore real, current time.

Example:

``` php
<?php

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
use SlopeIt\ClockMock\ClockMock;

class MyTestCase extends TestCase
{
    public function test_something_using_stateful_mocking_api()
    {
        ClockMock::freeze(new \DateTime('1986-06-05'));
        
        // Code executed in here, until ::reset is called, will use the above date and time as "current"
        $nowYmd = date('Y-m-d');
        
        ClockMock::reset();
        
        $this->assertEquals('1986-06-05', $nowYmd);
    }
}
```

### 2. Stateless API

The library also provides a closure-based API that will execute the provided code at a specific point in time. This API
does not need manually freezing or re-setting time, so it can be less error prone in some circumstances.

Example:

``` php
<?php

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
use SlopeIt\ClockMock\ClockMock;

class MyTestCase extends TestCase
{
    public function test_something_using_stateless_mocking_api()
    {
        $nowYmd = ClockMock::executeAtFrozenDateTime(new \DateTime('1986-06-05'), function () {
            // Code executed in here will use the above date and time as "current"
            return date('Y-m-d');
        });
        
        $this->assertEquals('1986-06-05', $nowYmd);
    }
}
```

## Credits

- [php-timecop](https://github.com/hnw/php-timecop), as ClockMock was inspired by it.
- [ext-uopz](https://github.com/krakjoe/uopz), as ClockMock is just a very thin layer on top of the amazing uopz
  extension, which provides a very convenient way to mock any function or method, including the ones of the php stdlib,
  at runtime.
